# Example of wrapper for get_cid_name.py which makes sure that the
# script doesn't take too much time to execute

# Limiting the execution time of get_cid_name.py is important because
# the script is designed to be executed at the beginning of each
# incoming phone call... and if the script get stucks, the phone call
# will also get stucks and you will miss the call !

# For Debian Lenny and Ubuntu Lucid, you need to install the package "timeout"
# For Ubuntu >= Maverick and Debian >= Squeeze, the "timeout" command is shipped
# in the "coreutils" package

# The first argument of the "timeout" command is the maximum execution time
# In this example, we chose 1 second

# This script has been extended to call the screen pop websocket server by Les Green <l.green@valuedecision.com>

# Connection options are command (timeout) / timeout time /
#     -s - openerp server address
#     -d - openerp database to connect to
#     -u - openerp id of the user with the right permissions
#     -w - openerp id user password
#     -z - web socket server address for pub / sub connection. (eg: openerp.valuedecision.com:9000  (no protocol)

timeout 1s /usr/local/bin/get_cid_name.py -s <serveripaddress> -d my_db -u 8 -w "openerppassword" -z <screenpopserveripaddress>:9000
